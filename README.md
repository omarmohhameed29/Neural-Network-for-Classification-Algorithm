# Neural-Network-for-Classification-Algorithm
This repository contains code for a deep learning model that classifies coffee as "good" or "bad" based on the temperature and duration of roasting. The model is implemented using TensorFlow and NumPy libraries.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model is generated using the load_data() function. This function generates a dataset with 1000 samples, each with two features: temperature (in Celsius) and duration (in minutes), and a label indicating whether the sample is "good" or "bad" coffee. The label is generated based on a predefined function that considers the temperature and duration of the roasting process.

## Dependencies
The code requires the following Python packages:

 .TensorFlow<br>
 .NumPy<br>
 .Matplotlib<br>
 

## Credits
This code is based on the TensorFlow tutorials and documentation.
